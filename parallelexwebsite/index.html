His lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. After accidentally eating the Gomu Gomu no Mi (Gum-Gum Fruit), a Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber, Luffy gained the ability to stretch his body like rubber.</p>
